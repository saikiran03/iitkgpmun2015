<b>Prashanth</b> is currently a senior at IIT Kharagpur. His passion for International politics and Public-Speaking has seen him attend several Model UN Conferences all over the country since his freshman year; he thrives off of it. Outside the class and conference room, he is a prolific athlete with an impressive record in sprinting and is also a trainee at the prestigious Indian Squash Academy. Having played a crucial role in the inception and the building of IITKGPMUN as a brand last year in the capacity of Secretary-General and governor of Debating Society, he is now very keen to take the conference to the next level.

<b>Adarsh</b> - fondly called Matthews in a cruel, mangled version of his surname - is a senior currently pursuing Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences at IIT Kharagpur. While not optimizing supply chain systems, he can be found doing a myriad of stuff, both good and bad. An avid writer, a seasoned debater, and a sports aficionado; he's what you call a jack-of-all-trades. A quirky pastime of his is formulating pet theories to explain what&#146;s happening around the world. An editor with the campus newspaper, and an ex-Governor of the Deb-Soc here, he prefers to participate in MUNs strictly as a member of the International Press. "Scrutinize, question, evaluate, and inform - that's what the Press does out there; that's what we should be aiming to do when we simulate it", he says.

<b>Vikram</b>, or as most people prefer, Voleti, is a fourth year student, currently pursuing a Dual Degree in Electrical Engineering. He is an optimist at heart who constantly tries to look at the bright side of situations, people, and life in general. He tries to dabble in all sorts of activities, which incidentally led to being the General Secretary of the Electrical Engineering Society, the Governor of the English Dramatics Society, and now this. A budding movie buff, his ultimate respite is watching a good film on the big screen with a couple of mates.
