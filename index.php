Dear Prospective Delegates,
</p>
<p>
It gives me great pleasure to invite you to the second session of IIT Kharagpur Model United Nations Conference which is to be held from 
<b>
Thursday, 24th January to Saturday, 26th January 2013.
</b>
</p>
<p>
The second IIT Kharagpur Model United Nations Conference, just like the previous edition, will provide an exciting and fast-paced environment of a fully-integrated crisis conference that boasts of both, a modern and a historical track. The three-day conference will put to test the crisis management, diplomacy and leadership skills of delegates, promoting constructive exchange of ideas and cultural networking among participants, all the while offering them an excellent opportunity to think in a strategic and analytical manner as well as to solve key problems of the human race with creative and bold ideas. 
In dissecting world affairs and creating policies, we hope to transform the students to future leaders and help them create unforgettable memories.
</p>
<p>
This year, in a bid to make the debate more interesting, we present two councils â€“ a historical NATO set in the year 1999 and DISEC, with the Kosovo Conflict and State sponsored terrorism as the agendas respectively.
</p>
<p>
For the fun part, a special delegate night will provide you with the perfect platform to socialize and learn about the delegates with whom you have worked over the course of the conference. Also, within the premises of IIT Kharagpur itself, you will be able to attend some of the best cultural performances by various big shots of the entertainment world.
</p>
<p>
Just like the first edition, you can expect the IIT Kharagpur coordinating staff to be as hospitable and welcoming to your visit as ever. We look forward to making your visit to the second IIT Kharagpur MUN a memorable one.
</p>
<p>
Sincerely,
<br>
Sanat Mehrotra
<br>
Secretary-General
