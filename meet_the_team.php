Prashanth is currently a junior at IIT Kharagpur. His passion for 
International politics and statecraft has seen him attend several Model 
UN conferences all over the country since his freshman year; he thrives 
off of it. In addition to being the Secretary-General, he actively 
contributes to Debating Society, IIT Kharagpur where he serves in the 
capacity of Governor and leads the inter-collegiate team in various 
debating events. Outside the class and conference room, he is a prolific
 athlete with an impressive record in sprinting and is also a trainee at
 the prestigious Indian Squash Academy. Known for his perfectionist 
demeanour and strategic planning, he hopes to provide you with a 
glitch-free conference and a unique and memorable Model UN experience.

Sanat is a sophomore studying Electronics with a secondary interest in 
Mathematics, especially Calculus. He has been hooked to the concept of 
MUN ever since his first conference in July this year. Apart from MUN, 
Parliamentary Debate is another form of public speaking that has 
captured Sanat’s imagination at college level. This Gurgaon lad who 
plays right-back for his college football team is also an avid reader 
and likes to play the guitar in his free time.

<p>
Vishnu is a freshman pursuing a dual degree in Biotechnology and 
Biochemical Engineering at IIT-Kharagpur. Having studied in Dubai, 
Bahrain and Hyderabad, his prodigious love for current affairs, world 
politics and really everything international gives him great motivation 
to be a forerunner when it comes to MUN. He also has an excellent 
working knowledge of Arabic, French and German, and has made cultural 
visits to 14 countries around the world including the UK, France and 
Singapore when still a school-student. Apart from being an avid reader 
of books and fascinated by all kinds of sports, Vishnu’s a typical 
hobby-geek, with involvements in Music vocals, cinematic dance and lawn 
tennis as well.

Adarsh, fondly called Matthews in a cruel, mangled version of his 
surname, is a junior currently pursuing Industrial Engineering and 
Management Sciences at IIT Kharagpur. While not optimizing supply chain 
systems, he can be found doing a myriad of stuff, both good and bad. An 
avid writer, a seasoned debater and a sports aficionado [famous for his 
scary ManUtd rants]; he's what you call a jack-of-all-trades. An 
assistant editor with the campus newspaper and a Governor of the Deb-Soc
 here, he claims the MUN International Press presents the perfect 
platform for him to pursue his journalistic passions on a formal level.

Barath is currently a junior at IIT Kharagpur. Having been brought up in
 Bangalore and Chennai, he adds to the South Indian flavor of the team, 
what with his childhood obsession of reading The Hindu sipping ‘filter 
kaapi’ extending into his college days, much to the exasperation of his 
wing mates. An Organizing Head in the Events Team of Spring Fest, his 
interests primarily lie in ‘checking out’ new rock music (he has no 
qualms revealing that rocknewsdesk.com is his homepage). His other 
interests include writing, reading and photography.

Rohit is a junior year student at IIT Kharagpur. He takes a special 
interest, almost obsessive, in travelling and has seen some of the most 
unseen corners of the country, thanks to his army background. A part of 
the Events Team of Spring Fest, his passion for philately is only beaten
 by his near-fanatical stock market following as he believes there is 
always a mathematical method behind the madness.

Arpita is a junior year student at IIT Kharagpur. A social freak to the 
letter, her fixation for dramatics and dance knows no bounds. A part of 
the Events Team of Spring Fest as well as the Hindi Dramatics Society of
 the institute, appreciation of fine art, she claims, is a virtue one 
has to be born with. Her other interests include singing and writing.
