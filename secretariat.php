<b>Sanat</b> is currently a third year undergrad at IIT Kharagpur. Although enrolled in the B.Tech Electronics course, he has found his niche in politics and world affairs rather than semiconductor devices.  Serving as Governor of the Deb-Soc at IIT Kharagpur and Assistant Editor at the campus newspaper, he also plays right-back for his college football team. Having already organized a successful conference last year, he is really excited about this year’s edition thanks to a talented and motivated team. Famous for his team-management skills and go-getter work ethics, Sanat hopes to take this year’s conference to a whole new level.

<b>Shreeja</b> is a third year Electronics student at IIT Kharagpur. Logic appeals to this girl in every aspect of life, and hence it was only natural that she took to debating in college and is now serving as the Governor of Debating Society. Apart from going to debates and MUNs, she likes to indulge in coding, reading novels and watching TV shows. In charge of hospitality and design at the conference last year, she hopes to replicate the smiles on last year's delegates in the coming edition. With ample managerial experience accumulated at organising college events, she plans on using her experience to ensure that a motivated team holds a smooth conference.

A sophomore of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, <b>Shushman</b> is greatly involved in the debating and MUNning activities of IIT Kharagpur. Having been a core member of the Research and Analysis Wing of the inaugural IITKGPMUN in 2012, he is back this year as Under Secretary General of Committees to hopefully ensure that the academic assistance provided to the delegates is top notch. Other than debating, he is avidly interested in robotics and computer programming. <br>

IITKGPMUN is very close to his heart as he was involved in its conception, and so he is full of aspirations for an even bigger and better conference this year. He welcomes all delegates to put their best foot forward towards that end.

<b>Mohit</b> is a sophomore at IIT Kharagpur pursuing his studies in Electronics. Mohit has two core passions - Engineering and Strategy - he pursues the former through his education at IIT, and the latter through a spectrum of events and competitions. He ran into MUNs through his search for platforms which could employ strategy - and liked it so much that he never looked back. When free, Mohit loves to travel, to read and to listen to ripe music.

<b>Anurag</b>, affectionately called 'Maadu', is a sophomore at IIT Kharagpur. He hails from Kolkata and therefore has a natural inclination towards 'adda' sessions revolving around philosophy and issues of national importance. An ardent squash player with a penchant for Mathematics, he is an enthusiastic participant in many events. He loves apples (can have them anytime) just as much as music and is also a Reporter for the campus newsletter. One can always see him with a pleasant smile though his closest pals call him an Intense Bore at times, as he can take things far too seriously.

Fondly called ‘Commander’ by her friends (thanks to her surname), <b>Vinodhini</b> is a junior pursing Mechanical Engineering at IIT Kharagpur. With a variety of interests including robotics and music, you can always see this Bangalorean involved in some activity or the other. Her passion for writing and public speaking led her to the IP team of IITKGPMUN 2012, which was an unparalleled exposure for her. An avid reader with an inquisitive nature, she aspires to take up research as her career. Apart from Carnatic vocals, she has a special liking towards astronomy and throw ball. Being an Assistant Editor for the campus newsletter and now the USG-IP for IITKGPMUN '13, she looks forward to gaining a new experience in journalism. She wishes all the delegates a spectacular MUNning experience at IIT KGP!
